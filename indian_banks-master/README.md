# Indian Bank IFSC Codes

Based on [MySQL dump](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/indian-bank-ifsc-branch-database-sql) which, in turn, is based on the unwieldy [excel file from RBI](http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/docs/68774.xls). I doubt if I'll be updating this very often, but am happy to accept pull requests. Things that could come in are MICR codes, SWIFT codes.

# CSV Dump

See bank_branches.csv file. If you prefer a PostgreSQL dump for building a service or some such, look at the .sql file.

# Dump of PostgreSQL tables with IFSC codes of bank branches.

The SQL dump has two table and one view.
* **banks** - has two columns id and name (e.g. ICICI). The id was generated by me and is not universal.
* **branches** - has details of all branches. IFSC code is the primary key of this table. Has bank_id which is a foreign key reference into banks table.
* **bank_branches** - view on top of these tables that joins on bank_id. Convenient if you want to search by bank name
